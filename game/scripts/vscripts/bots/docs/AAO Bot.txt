Version 3.0

This is the third version of my OAA bot. It is a complete (and infinitely more functional) rewrite of my first and second bots.

V3 New Features:
-Bots will now pick up and use infinity bottles. They won't ever use the last charge because - due to a bug in infinity bottle - it will crash the game if they do.
-Bots now correctly use almost all their spells against neutrals.
-Bots now level up all talents and skills as much as they are able. They will prioritize their best farming skills first.
-When a bot gets beaten up by a neutral camp (or hero), the bot will invisibly ping to the other bots, who will come and throw bodies at the camp (or hero) until it has been culled.
-If you hold a smoke in the first slot of your backpack, all your bots will follow you, and fight heroes and creeps as they go.
-If you hold a smoke in the second slot of your backpack, they will follow you, but won't fight creeps, only heroes. Good for ganking as a team.
-Smoke in any other slot won't have any effect.
-The bots do basic warding (if only to empty their inventry of junk)
-I can't claim this, but Dota now has an improvement where bots will drop what they are doing and respond to pings now, albeit badly. I put in the "smoke follow code" because they didn't do that initially.

V2 Improvements:
-All of the code is split up and controlled by desires.
-Hero vs Hero fighting is taken over by default AI. It does the best job.
-The bot knows when it's in a duel and fights almost to the death now since it can't retreat.
-The Farming is completely taken over, and bots uses more spells which makes farming large camps a lot easier.
-Changed main file to mode_laning_generic to stop bots running in a random direction during duel
-I have the bots five man a couple of medium camps at the beginning for the xp.
-A thousand little tweaks and bug fixes.

Bugs:
They will get their pathing messed up occasionally
Theoretically the bots could keep throwing themselves at an impossible camp (or boss), but they tend to get there in the end.
It's not a bug, but some of the heros are just plain shitty at farming, and I can't filter them out of the hero pool unfortunately.
Any unexpected bugs I haven't seen yet.

Finishing touches to come:
Upgrading items (needs to happen soon)
Deciding when to fight bosses.
AI deciding whether taking a Hero vs Hero fight is a good idea or not.
